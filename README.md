# Pattern Recognition
A group project that was developed as a university assignment for the subject "Pattern Recognition".
The goal of this project is to build an end to end solution or application that is capable of predicting the house prices using the "housing.csv" dataset that includes some objective characteristics of the houses that exist in each geographical area. The data included are processed using the Pandas library. We implement three algorithms: Least Mean Squares using gradient descent model, Least Mean Squares using linear regression model and finally, we use a neural network with multilayer perceptron with non-linear regression to make predictions on houses' median value.

**Group members involved in this project:**<br>
Athanasios Bitakis, Dimitrios Panagiotopoulos, Avgerinos Christos.
